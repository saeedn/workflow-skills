# Workflow Configuration

This file provides project-specific settings consumed by the generic workflow skills
(`review-goals`, `create-html-mock`, `extract-requirements-from-mock`, `write-requirements`,
`write-architecture`, `write-implementation-plan`, `execute-implementation-plan`, `fix-bug`).

**Setup:** Copy this file into your project at `.claude/skills/workflow-config.md` and replace
all `<PLACEHOLDER>` values with your project's specifics. Delete any sections that don't apply
to your project.

## Feature docs directory

Feature documentation lives at:

```
<PATH_TO_FEATURE_DOCS>
```

Example: `docs/features/`, `agent_docs/`, etc.

Within this directory, each feature has its own folder named `<feature-name>/`, containing
`goals.md`, `requirements.md`, `architecture.md`, `mocks.html`, `mocks.context.md`,
and `implementation_plan/` as applicable.

## Quality commands

Run these commands to verify code quality. All must pass before committing.

- **Format**: `<FORMAT_COMMAND>`
- **Check (lint + typecheck)**: `<CHECK_COMMAND>`
- **Unit tests**: `<UNIT_TEST_COMMAND>`

## Product identity

The product is called **<PRODUCT_NAME>**. When creating HTML mocks, match the look and feel of
the existing UI. Don't guess at what it looks like — read the UI code and create a close
approximation.

(Delete this section if not relevant, e.g. for backend-only projects.)

## Test conventions

### Test locations

<DESCRIBE_WHERE_EACH_TYPE_OF_TEST_LIVES_AND_HOW_THEY_ARE_NAMED>

Example:
```
- End-to-end tests: `tests/e2e/` — named `test_<feature>.py`
- Unit tests: alongside source files — `foo_test.py` for `foo.py`
```

### Test authoring guidance

<DESCRIBE_ANY_PROJECT_SPECIFIC_TEST_CONVENTIONS_FRAMEWORKS_OR_PATTERNS>

Example: "Tests use Playwright for browser automation. Use `data-testid` attributes for
element selectors. End-to-end tests require a running database seeded via fixtures."

(Delete this subsection if not applicable.)

## Related skills

These project-specific skills are referenced by the workflow skills. If a skill is not
available in your project, the instruction referencing it can be skipped.

- **Manual testing / screenshots**: `<SKILL_NAME_OR_DELETE>` — launch the app and interact
  with the UI to take screenshots or manually test features.
- **Write end-to-end test**: `<SKILL_NAME_OR_DELETE>` — instructions for writing new
  end-to-end tests, including framework setup and test patterns.
- **Run end-to-end tests**: `<SKILL_NAME_OR_DELETE>` — MUST be used to run end-to-end tests
  (never run them directly).
- **Debug end-to-end tests**: `<SKILL_NAME_OR_DELETE>` — debug failing end-to-end tests,
  covers common failure modes and investigation strategies.

(Delete any entries that don't apply. Delete this entire section if you have no related skills.)

## Database migrations

<DESCRIBE_MIGRATION_TOOLING_OR_DELETE_THIS_SECTION>

Example:
```
npx prisma migrate dev --name "<migration message>"
```

(Delete this section if your project doesn't use database migrations.)
